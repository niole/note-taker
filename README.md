Then...
1. Open chrome extensions at `chrome://extensions` in your chrome browser.
2. Turn on Developer mode
3. Click `Load Unpacked` button
4. Upload the directory that contains the extension
5. Use the extension interface in order to interact with it in your browser. You will
have to reload the extension every time the elm finishes recompiling.
